mostly all aptitude tests that have a technical round will have some variation of array questions. though it may be time consuming
you can't get away without practice or some sort of experience. 
Here are some freely available samples that i think teach you something, it is important to know that you must know other data structures
as well and all the common sorting and searching algorithms;

1. How to find the missing number in integer array of 1 to 100? 
One trick to solve this problem is to calculate sum of all numbers in the array and
compare with expected sum, the difference would be the missing number.
2. How to find duplicate number on Integer array in Java?
 you can apply the same trick of comparing actual sum of an array to expected sum of
 series to find out that duplicate. This is generally asked as follow-up question of previous problem.
 Linkedhashset and Set
 
 3. How to check if array contains a number in Java?
The complexity of binary search is O(logN). BTW, if interviewer says that array is not sorted then you can still sort 
and perform binary search otherwise you can use sequential search. Time complexity of sequential search in array is O(n).
4. How to find largest and smallest number in unsorted array?
5. How to find all pairs on integer array whose sum is equal to given number?
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;
if(numbers.length < 2){
            return;
        }        
        Set set = new HashSet(numbers.length);
        
        for(int value : numbers){
            int target = n - value;
            
            // if target number is not in set then add
            if(!set.contains(target)){
                set.add(value);
            }else {
                System.out.printf("(%d, %d) %n", value, target);
            }
        }
